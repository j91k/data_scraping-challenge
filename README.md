# Project: Mars News and Weather Data Analysis

### Background
Explored web scraping techniques to gather data on Mars news articles and weather conditions using automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup.

## Deliverables:
**Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News**

Automated browsing visited the Mars news site and used Beautiful Soup to extract titles and preview text from news articles. The scraped data was stored in Python dictionaries.

**Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data**

Automated browsing scraped Mars weather data from an HTML table using Beautiful Soup, organized the data into a Pandas DataFrame and performed analysis to answer specific questions about Martian weather conditions. Exported the DataFrame to a CSV file for further use.
